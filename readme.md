## Note
- i've tried to get the cookies to work, but as it is right now, i don't get them in the header when "GET" in swagger are activated. therefore have i moved the cookie handler to another class, and will prob try to figure out what is going on, but that will be at a later date. 

- Moving forward i will try another like a token instead.
